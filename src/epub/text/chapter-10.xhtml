				<p epub:type="title">New York to Paris</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>At New York we checked over the plane, engine and instruments, which required several short flights over the field.</p>
			<p>When the plane was completely inspected and ready for the transatlantic flight, there were dense fogs reported along the coast and over Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, in addition to a storm area over the North Atlantic.</p>
			<p>On the morning of May 19th, a light rain was falling and the sky was overcast. Weather reports from land stations and ships along the great circle course were unfavorable and there was apparently no prospect of taking off for Paris for several days at least. In the morning I visited the Wright plant at Paterson, New Jersey, and had planned to attend a theatre performance in New York that evening. But at about six o’clock I received a special report from the New York Weather Bureau. A high pressure area was over the entire North Atlantic and the low pressure over Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was receding. It was apparent that the prospects of the fog clearing up were as good as I might expect for some time to come. The North Atlantic should be clear with only local storms on the coast of Europe. The moon had just passed full and the percentage of days with fog over Newfoundland and the Grand Banks was increasing so that there seemed to be no advantage in waiting longer.</p>
			<p>We went to Curtiss Field as quickly as possible and made arrangements for the barograph to be sealed and installed, and for the plane to be serviced and checked.</p>
			<p>We decided partially to fill the fuel tanks in the hangar before towing the ship on a truck to Roosevelt Field, which adjoins Curtiss on the east, where the servicing would be completed.</p>
			<p>I left the responsibility for conditioning the plane in the hands of the men on the field while I went into the hotel for about two and one-half hours of rest; but at the hotel there were several more details which had to be completed and I was unable to get any sleep that night.</p>
			<p>I returned to the field before daybreak on the morning of the twentieth. A light rain was falling which continued until almost dawn; consequently we did not move the ship to Roosevelt Field until much later than we had planned, and the takeoff was delayed from daybreak until nearly eight o’clock.</p>
			<p>At dawn the shower had passed, although the sky was overcast, and occasionally there would be some slight precipitation. The tail of the plane was lashed to a truck and escorted by a number of motorcycle police. The slow trip from Curtiss to Roosevelt was begun.</p>
			<p>The ship was placed at the extreme west end of the field heading along the east and west runway, and the final fueling commenced.</p>
			<p>About 7:40 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> the motor was started and at 7:52 I took-off on the flight for Paris.</p>
			<p>The field was a little soft due to the rain during the night and the heavily loaded plane gathered speed very slowly. After passing the halfway mark, however, it was apparent that I would be able to clear the obstructions at the end. I passed over a tractor by about fifteen feet and a telephone line by about twenty, with a fair reserve of flying speed. I believe that the ship would have taken off from a hard field with at least five hundred pounds more weight.</p>
			<p>I turned slightly to the right to avoid some high trees on a hill directly ahead, but by the time I had gone a few hundred yards I had sufficient altitude to clear all obstructions and throttled the engine down to 1,750 <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">R.P.M.</abbr> I took up a compass course at once and soon reached Long Island Sound where the Curtiss Oriole with its photographer, which had been escorting me, turned back.</p>
			<p>The haze soon cleared and from Cape Cod through the southern half of Nova Scotia the weather and visibility were excellent. I was flying very low, sometimes as close as ten feet from the trees and water.</p>
			<p>On the three hundred mile stretch of water between Cape Cod and Nova Scotia I passed within view of numerous fishing vessels.</p>
			<p>The northern part of Nova Scotia contained a number of storm areas and several times I flew through cloudbursts.</p>
			<p>As I neared the northern coast, snow appeared in patches on the ground and far to the eastward the coastline was covered with fog.</p>
			<p>For many miles between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland the ocean was covered with caked ice but as I approached the coast the ice disappeared entirely and I saw several ships in this area.</p>
			<p>I had taken up a course for <abbr>St.</abbr> Johns, which is south of the great Circle from New York to Paris, so that there would be no question of the fact that I had passed Newfoundland in case I was forced down in the north Atlantic.</p>
			<p>I passed over numerous icebergs after leaving <abbr>St.</abbr> Johns, but saw no ships except near the coast.</p>
			<p>Darkness set in about 8:15 and a thin, low fog formed over the sea through which the white bergs showed up with surprising clearness. This fog became thicker and increased in height until within two hours I was just skimming the top of storm clouds at about ten thousand feet. Even at this altitude there was a thick haze through which only the stars directly overhead could be seen.</p>
			<p>There was no moon and it was very dark. The tops of some of the storm clouds were several thousand feet above me and at one time, when I attempted to fly through one of the larger clouds, sleet started to collect on the plane and I was forced to turn around and get back into clear air immediately and then fly around any clouds which I could not get over.</p>
			<p>The moon appeared on the horizon after about two hours of darkness; then the flying was much less complicated.</p>
			<p>Dawn came at about 1 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> New York time and the temperature had risen until there was practically no remaining danger of sleet.</p>
			<p>Shortly after sunrise the clouds became more broken although some of them were far above me and it was often necessary to fly through them, navigating by instruments only.</p>
			<p>As the sun became higher, holes appeared in the fog. Through one the open water was visible, and I dropped down until less than a hundred feet above the waves. There was a strong wind blowing from the northwest and the ocean was covered with white caps.</p>
			<p>After a few miles of fairly clear weather the ceiling lowered to zero and for nearly two hours I flew entirely blind through the fog at an altitude of about 1,500 feet. Then the fog raised and the water was visible again.</p>
			<p>On several more occasions it was necessary to fly by instrument for short periods; then the fog broke up into patches. These patches took on forms of every description. Numerous shorelines appeared, with trees perfectly outlined against the horizon. In fact, the mirages were so natural that, had I not been in mid-Atlantic and known that no land existed along my route, I would have taken them to be actual islands.</p>
			<p>As the fog cleared I dropped down closer to the water, sometimes flying within ten feet of the waves and seldom higher than two hundred.</p>
			<p>There is a cushion of air close to the ground or water through which a plane flies with less effort than when at a higher altitude, and for hours at a time I took advantage of this factor.</p>
			<p>Also, it was less difficult to determine the wind drift near the water. During the entire flight the wind was strong enough to produce white caps on the waves. When one of these formed, the foam would be blown off, showing the wind’s direction and approximate velocity. This foam remained on the water long enough for me to obtain a general idea of my drift.</p>
			<p>During the day I saw a number of porpoises and a few birds but no ships, although I understand that two different boats reported me passing over.</p>
			<p>The first indication of my approach to the European Coast was a small fishing boat which I first noticed a few miles ahead and slightly to the south of my course. There were several of these fishing boats grouped within a few miles of each other.</p>
			<p>I flew over the first boat without seeing any signs of life. As I circled over the second, however, a man’s face appeared, looking out of the cabin window.</p>
			<p>I have carried on short conversations with people on the ground by flying low with throttled engine, shouting a question, and receiving the answer by some signal. When I saw this fisherman I decided to try to get him to point towards land. I had no sooner made the decision than the futility of the effort became apparent. In all likelihood he could not speak English, and even if he could he would undoubtedly be far too astounded to answer. However, I circled again and closing the throttle as the plane passed within a few feet of the boat I shouted, “Which way is Ireland?” Of course the attempt was useless, and I continued on my course.</p>
			<p>Less than an hour later a rugged and semi-mountainous coastline appeared to the northeast. I was flying less than two hundred feet from the water when I sighted it. The shore was fairly distinct and not over ten or fifteen miles away. A light haze coupled with numerous local storm areas had prevented my seeing it from a long distance.</p>
			<p>The coastline came down from the north, curved over towards the east. I had very little doubt that it was the southwestern end of Ireland but in order to make sure I changed my course towards the nearest point of land.</p>
			<p>I located Cape Valentia and Dingle Bay, then resumed my compass course towards Paris.</p>
			<p>After leaving Ireland I passed a number of steamers and was seldom out of sight of a ship.</p>
			<p>In a little over two hours the coast of England appeared. My course passed over Southern England and a little south of Plymouth; then across the English Channel, striking France over Cherbourg.</p>
			<p>The English farms were very impressive from the air in contrast to ours in America. They appeared extremely small and unusually neat and tidy with their stone and hedge fences.</p>
			<p>I was flying at about a fifteen hundred foot altitude over England and as I crossed the Channel and passed over Cherbourg, France, I had probably seen more of that part of Europe than many native Europeans. The visibility was good and the country could be seen for miles around.</p>
			<p>People who have taken their first flight often remark that no one knows what the locality he lives in is like until he has seen it from above. Countries take on different characteristics from the air.</p>
			<p>The sun went down shortly after passing Cherbourg and soon the beacons along the Paris-London airway became visible.</p>
			<p>I first saw the lights of Paris a little before ten <abbr>p.m.</abbr>, or five <abbr>p.m.</abbr> New York time, and a few minutes later I was circling the Eiffel Tower at an altitude of about four thousand feet.</p>
			<p>The lights of Le Bourget were plainly visible, but appeared to be very close to Paris. I had understood that the field was farther from the city, so continued out to the northeast into the country for four or five miles to make sure that there was not another field farther out which might be Le Bourget. Then I returned and spiralled down closer to the lights. Presently I could make out long lines of hangars, and the roads appeared to be jammed with cars.</p>
			<p>I flew low over the field once, then circled around into the wind and landed.</p>
			<p>After the plane stopped rolling I turned it around and started to taxi back to the lights. The entire field ahead, however, was covered with thousands of people all running towards my ship. When the first few arrived, I attempted to get them to hold the rest of the crowd back, away from the plane, but apparently no one could understand, or would have been able to conform to my request if he had.</p>
			<p>I cut the switch to keep the propeller from killing someone, and attempted to organize an impromptu guard for the plane. The impossibility of any immediate organization became apparent, and when parts of the ship began to crack from the pressure of the multitude I decided to climb out of the cockpit in order to draw the crowd away.</p>
			<p>Speaking was impossible; no words could be heard in the uproar and nobody apparently cared to hear any. I started to climb out of the cockpit, but as soon as one foot appeared through the door I was dragged the rest of the way without assistance on my part.</p>
			<p>For nearly half an hour I was unable to touch the ground, during which time I was ardently carried around in what seemed to be a very small area, and in every position it is possible to be in. Everyone had the best of intentions but no one seemed to know just what they were.</p>
			<p>The French military flyers very resourcefully took the situation in hand. A number of them mingled with the crowd; then, at a given signal, they placed my helmet on an American correspondent and cried: “Here is Lindbergh.” That helmet on an American was sufficient evidence. The correspondent immediately became the center of attraction, and while he was being taken protestingly to the Reception Committee via a rather devious route, I managed to get inside one of the hangars.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile a second group of soldiers and police had surrounded the plane and soon placed it out of danger in another hangar.</p>
			<p>The French ability to handle an unusual situation with speed and capability was remarkably demonstrated that night at Le Bourget.</p>

			<p>Ambassador Herrick extended me an invitation to remain at his Embassy while I was in Paris, which I gladly accepted. But grateful as I was at the time, it did not take me long to realize that a kind Providence had placed me in Ambassador Herrick’s hands. The ensuing days found me in situations that I had certainly never expected to be in and in which I relied on Ambassador Herrick’s sympathetic aid.</p>
			<p>These situations were brought about by the wholehearted welcome to me⁠—an American⁠—that touched me beyond any point that any words can express. I left France with a debt of gratitude which, though I cannot repay it, I shall always remember. If the French people had been acclaiming their own gallant airmen, Nungesser and Coli, who were lost only after fearlessly departing in the face of conditions insurmountably greater than those that confronted me, their enthusiastic welcome and graciousness could not have been greater.</p>
			<p>In Belgium as well, I was received with a warmth which reflected more than simply a passing curiosity in a transatlantic flight, but which was rather a demonstration by the people of their interest in a new means of transportation which eventually would bring still closer together the new world and the old. Their welcome, too, will be a cherished memory for all time.</p>
			<p>In England, I experienced one final unforgettable demonstration of friendship for an American. That spontaneous wonderful reception during my brief visit seemed typical of what I had always heard of the good sportsmanship of the English.</p>
			<p>My words to all those friends in Europe are inadequate, but my feelings of appreciation are boundless.</p>

					<p>Conclusion</p>
				</header>
				<p>When I was contemplating the flight to Paris I looked forward to making a short tour of Europe with especial regard to the various airports and aeronautical activities.</p>
				<p>After I arrived, however, the necessity for returning to America in the near future became apparent and, after a consultation with Ambassador Houghton, who informed me that President Coolidge was sending the cruiser <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Memphis</i> to Cherbourg for my return journey to America, I flew the <i epub:type="se:name.vehicle.airplane">Spirit of <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis</i> to Gosport early one morning. There it was dismantled and crated, through the courtesy of the Royal Air Force which also placed a Woodcock pursuit plane at my disposal.</p>
				<p>I returned to London in the Woodcock and a few days later flew to Paris in another <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">R.A.F.</abbr> machine of the same type.</p>
				<p>I remained overnight in Paris, and early the next morning flew a French Breguet to Cherbourg where the cruiser <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Memphis</i> was waiting.</p>
				<p>Admiral Burrage met me at the dock, and after going aboard the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Memphis</i> I became acquainted with Captain Lackey and the officers of the ship. During the trip across they extended every courtesy and did everything within their power to make the voyage a pleasant one.</p>
				<p>A description of my welcome back to the United States would, in itself, be sufficient to fill a larger volume than this. I am not an author by profession, and my pen could never express the gratitude which I feel towards the American people.</p>
				<p>The voyage up the Potomac and to the Monument Grounds in Washington; up the Hudson River and along Broadway; over the Mississippi and to <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis⁠—to do justice to these occasions would require a far greater writer than myself.</p>
				<p>Washington, New York, and finally <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis and home. Each of these cities has left me with an impression that I shall never forget, and a debt of gratitude which I can never repay.</p>
