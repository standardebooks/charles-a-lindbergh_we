			<p>When Lindbergh came to tell the story of his welcome at Paris, London, Brussels, Washington, New York and <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis he found himself up against a tougher problem than flying the Atlantic.</p>
			<p>He wanted to speak from his heart his appreciation for all the kindness and enthusiasm that had been shown him. But when he began to write he found that fitting words would not come. Somehow it wasn’t a story for him to tell.</p>
			<p>So the publishers agreed to his suggestion that this part of the record be put in the third person by a writer he might choose. As a result much in the way of illuminating speeches and other important matter is included that Lindbergh would have been loath to use.</p>
